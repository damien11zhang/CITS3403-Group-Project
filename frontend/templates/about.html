    <h1>Helping You Find Your Path</h1>
    <p>
      Choosing a career is one of the most important decisions a person will make — yet for many young people, it's also one of the most overwhelming. 
      We saw countless friends, classmates, and peers struggling with the uncertainty of 'what to do next,' feeling lost when trying to navigate such a huge life decision.
    </p>
    <p>

      Our mission is to simplify this process, making it easier, more personalized, and less stressful.
      We want to empower you to move forward with confidence toward a future that's right for you.
